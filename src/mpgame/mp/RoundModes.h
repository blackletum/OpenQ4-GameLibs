rvClanArenaGameState

Round based team elimination.  Item pickups do not decide anything: everyone
spawns with the full arsenal and the round goes to whoever is left standing.
Personal score comes from damage dealt rather than frags, so a player who
softens up the enemy team is credited for it.

rvFreezeTagGameState

Death freezes rather than kills.  A frozen player stays put as a body any team
mate can stand next to and thaw; a team is out when every one of them is
frozen at once.

The body is the dead player themselves rather than a separate entity: Quake 4
already leaves the corpse in place until the player asks to respawn, and it is
already replicated, so Freeze Tag needs no new entity and no new map content.

rvRedRoverGameState

A death moves the victim onto the opposite side, so the round ends when one
side has absorbed everybody.  Nobody is eliminated, so respawns stay normal
and only the team assignment changes.

Red Rover is the one team mode Quake Live reports on individual score rather
than team score, and its round limit counts total rounds played rather than
rounds won by either side.
